Hi, thank you for your time and reviewing my submission for the assignment.

I used conda for this project to manage packages properly.

Packages/versions used:

python3.7

pandas 1.3.4 

numpy 1.21.2

sqlite3 3.36.0

seaborn 0.11.2

matplotlib 3.5.0

To create a database, first run:
python database_init.py

Then for analysis and reports run:
python analysis.py


I spend my time to explore and understand the business problem, preprocess data, analyze it and try to convience the EV client to use electricityMap.

I thought of doing time-series forecasting with HoltWinters to predict next 24 hours of carbon intensity, would you like me to do it?

My report for the client is in Report folder.
